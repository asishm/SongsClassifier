 said that I'ma ride for my motherfucking niggas,
most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain't going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga

First things first, I love all of my niggas
This rap shit crack, then I involve my niggas
You looking for some lean, let me call my niggas

Some niggas smoke, smoke some niggas drink, drink
Got niggas on the block with the glock they dont think
