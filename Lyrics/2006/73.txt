The thieves are ready
Mommies are ready
On the street we are ready
Yeah yeah we walk ready

The neighbourhoods are ready
One, two get ready come on
Oh oh oh oh!

Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Broken, broken, broken
That body she
Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Are u ready?

Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Broken, broken, broken
The way she move she
Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Let's go !!

My boo is not limited to the time of breaking his pum pum
With more curves hotter than the south, right through
name if you have the attitude, mami
Dale, go, go, go, go, go go

Time, I get the baby moment of losing control
that more body than a shot of Winstrong
Upload that temperament, give slow-moving, slow she

Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Broken, broken, broken
That body she
Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Are u ready ?!

Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Broken, broken, broken
The way she move she
Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Go, go, go, go

I'm chilling 'quiet that's right
Looking for a cat falling
Do not hide all that you bring
I baby, that is there?

I'm chilling 'quiet that's right
Looking for a cat falling
Do not hide all that you bring
Happens, partner? What is there?

Click pensastes ox that this was a mami
I will not give break, leave that guille Scarface
Get out my way, you do not sell or eBay

Check out the swing
That sticks to to'a the girls but a G-string
I am the nightmare of all the dream team
you already finished the magazine
Do not guilles me pa 'of Listen, Daddy you

Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Broken, broken, broken
That body she
Broken, broken, broken
Well Guilla'o
Are u ready?

Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Broken, broken, broken
The way she move she
Broken, broken, broken
Break it down
Let's go!
