Ay, ay, ay
come on in, let's go Yeah, lets go
Alright, Alright OK
Alright OK
Alright OK

Return of the Mack's, get 'em
What it is what it does what it is what it isn't
Lookin' for a better way to get up out of bed instead of getting on the internet and checking a new hit, get up!
Thrift shop, cool strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cocky
Somewhere between like Rocky and Cosby
Sweater game nope nope y'all can't copy

Yup. Bad, moonwalking
This here, is our party
My posse's been on Broadway
And we did it, our way
Throne music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it
And yet I'm on
Let that stage light go and shine on down
Got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style
Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds
But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town
Trust me. on my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T hustlin'
Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing
Halfway cross that city with the backpack
Fat cat, crushin labels off
Yeah, Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give that to the people
Spread it across the country
Labels out here
Nah they can't tell me nothing
We give it to the people
Spread it across the country

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Now can I kick it? thank you
Yeah I'm so damn grateful
I grew up, really wanted gold fronts
But that's what you get when Wu-Tang raised you
Yall can't stop me
Go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat
And I'm eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week
Raw. Tell me go up. Gone!
Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome
Ceasar will make you a believer
Nah I never ever did it for a throne
That validation comes from giving it back to the people.
Nah sing a song and it goes like
Raise those hands, this is our party
We came here to live life like nobody was watching
I got my city right behind me, if I fall, they got me
Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

So we put our hands up
So we put our hands up

Lets go

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
And all my people say

Na na na na na na na na
Macklemore

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

Can we go back, this is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till its over
So we put our hands up like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us
