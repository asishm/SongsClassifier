You fly as hell, swagga right, brown skin poppin'
You know just how to talk to me
Know just how I like it
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on

Now wait a minute little buster
You got one more time to feel on my booty
Better recognize a lady
That ain't the way you do me
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin' me
Dime divas give it to me
I gotta be feeling your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman

Going up on it, you acting like you want it
And you stuntin' like your daddy checkin' for this little mama
You turnin' me on, you turnin' me on, you turnin' me on

Now wait a minute little buster
Now you don't even know me but you wanna take me shopping
You a lame, I can tell it ain't big shit poppin
You turnin' me off, you turnin' me off, you turnin' me off
Better recognize a real woman

All you wanna do is holla at the cutest broad to get up in them draws
Got money, don't try to buy me bottles, got my own dollars
I could buy up the bar if I want it

You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
I gotta be feeling your energy
I gotta be for sure that you're into me
Recognize a real woman
