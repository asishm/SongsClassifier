I will look, I breath
When you look at me I turn up the heart
(I slow the heart beats)
And quietly your look tells a thousand words
The night that I implore you to not leave the sun

Your body and mine filling the void
Up and down (up and down)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
That fire inside me going crazy
I will saturating

With your physical and your chemistry also your anatomy
Beer and tequila and your mouth with mine
I can no more (I can no more) I can no more (I can no more)
With this tune, your color, your fantasy
With your philosophy my head is empty
And I can no more (I can no more)
I can no more (I can no more)

I want to be with you, living with you
Dance with you, have you
A crazy night (a crazy night)
Oh kiss your mouth (and kiss your mouth)
I want to be with you, living with you
Dance with you, you have a crazy night
With tremendous note
(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh)

You look at me and take me to another dimension

Your heartbeat accelerates my heart
(Your heartbeat accelerates my heart)
Irony of fate that can not touch you
Hold and feel the magic of your scent

Your body and mine filling the void
Up and down (up and down)
(Dancing, dancing, dancing, dancing)
That fire inside me going crazy
I will saturating

With your physical and your chemistry also your anatomy
Beer and tequila and your mouth with mine
I can no more (I can no more)
I can no more (I can no more)
With this tune, your color, your fantasy
With your philosophy my head is empty
And I can no more (I can no more)
I can no more (I can no more)

I want to be with you, living with you
Dance with you, have you
A crazy night (a crazy night)
Oh kiss your mouth (and kiss your mouth)
I want to be with you, living with you
Dance with you, you have a crazy night
With tremendous note

(Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, ooooh, ooooh
Ooooh ooooh love dancing
Ooooh love dancing is that I will pain
Ooooh).
