Back door cracked, we don't need a key
We get in for free, no V.I.P. sleaze,
Drink that Kool-Aid follow my lead,
Now you're one of us, you're coming with me

It's time to kill the lights and shut the DJ down
(This place's about to)
Tonight we're taking over, no one's getting out

This place's about to blow-oh-oh-oh!
Blow-oh-oh-oh
(This place about to)

Now what? What? We're taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don't
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We're pretty and sick
We're young and we're bored
It's time to lose your mind and let the crazy out
(This place about to)
Tonight we're taking names 'cause we don't mess around

This place about to blow-oh-oh-oh!
Blow-oh-oh-oh

Go, go, go, go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands, let me, let me see them hands
Go insane, go insane
Throw some glitter, make it rain on 'em
Let me see them hands, let me, let me see them hands

We are taking over...
Get used to it ok...

Oh, this place about to blow-oh-oh-oh!
Blow-oh-oh-oh

This place about to blow...
