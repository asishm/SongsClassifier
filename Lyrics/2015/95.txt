Tell me if it is true 
I told you these wedding 
You do not know how I'm suffering 
This will have to tell

Tell 
Your farewell was hard for me 
Will he take you to the moon 
And I do not know well

I was looking 
through the streets shouting 
That is killing me oh no

I was looking 
through the streets screaming 
like a madman taking oh ...

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
I do not like 
this do not like

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
I do not like 
That do not like

If you live, I can not stand 
why I come to tell you what I feel 
I am suffering in this solitude

And though your father did not approve of this relationship 
I still insist to ask forgiveness 
All that matters is in your heart

I was looking 
through the streets shouting 
This is killing me oh no

I was looking 
through the streets screaming 
like a madman taking oh ...

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
I do not like 
this do not like

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
I do not like 
That do not like

I swore eternal love to you 
now another gives you warm 
when you are cold at night oh oh

I know he'll look better 
But I am in your heart 
And for that I apologize

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
That I do not like oh no

Is that I do without you 
and you without me 
Tell me who can be happy 
I do not like oh yeah ...

They say you do not know what you have 
until you lose it but ... 
(I without you) 
worth fighting for what you want 
(I can not live like this ) 
And make the attempt 
(not want to live like that )
