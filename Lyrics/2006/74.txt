Bass, hi-hat
808, Jay, ready
Lets go get 'em
Come on

I used to run base like Juan Pierre
Now I run the bass hi-hat and the snare
I used to bag girls like purple bags
Now I bag B., boy you hurting that

Brooklyn bay where they birthed me at
Now be everywhere they never at
The audacity to have me with them curtains back
Me and B., she about to steam, stand back

Baby, seem like everywhere I go I seek you
From your eyes I smile, it's like I breathe you
Helplessly I reminisce, don't want to
Compare nobody to you

Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu

Seeing things that I know can't be, am I dreaming?
When I saw you walkingâ€™ past me, almost called your name
Got a better glimpse and then I looked away
'Cause like I'm losing it

Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu

Yes, Hova's flow so unusual
Baby girl you should already know


It's H-O, light up the dro
'Cause you gonna need help

Tryna study my, bounce
Flow glow, what's the difference
One you take in vein while the other you sniffin'
It's still dough, po-po try to convict 'em

Thats a no-go my dough keep the scales tippin' like 4-4s
Like her from the H O U S T O N
Blow wind, so Chicago of him
Is he the best ever? That's the argument

I don't make the list, don't be mad at me
I just make the hits like a fact of free
I'm just one to one nuttin' after me
No deja vu, just me and my OH

Baby I can't go anywhere
Without thinking that you're there
Seems like you're everywhere, it's true
Gotta be having deja vu

'Cause in my mind I want you here
Get on the next plane, I don't care
Is it because I'm missing you?
That I'm having deja vu

Boy, I try to catch myself but I'm out of control
Your sexiness is so appealing, I can't let it go

Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu

Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
Know that I can't get over you, 'cause everything I see is you
And I don't want no substitute, baby, I swear it's deja vu
