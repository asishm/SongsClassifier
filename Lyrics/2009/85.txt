Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Tried my best at movin' on
Have yet to find a girl like you
See things now I didn't before
Now wishin' I had more time with you

How do you stay awake
Knowin' all I do is think of you
All the things we thought about
Then, never will happen again
If I could just see you

If I had my way i'd come and get you girl
In your favourite car with the missing top
Around my way where we used to park
And did all those things to steal your heart

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Baby all that I hear from my friends
Again again and again come and ask 'bout you
They say, "We saw your girl at the game
And damn we gotta say a big mistake by you"

Not only does your body bang
But I miss the conversation too
Tell me that you're gettin' more sleep
Can't think can't eat till I come see you

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh
Oh-uh oh-uh oh-uh oh

It's been about a year now
Ain't seen or heard from you
I've been missing you crazy
How do you how do you sleep
I found the letter you wrote me
It still smells just like you
Damn those sweet memories
How do you how do you sleep?
How do you sleep?

It's been about a year now

How do you sleep?
