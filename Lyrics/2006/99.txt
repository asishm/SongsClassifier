I'm wandering the streets in a world underneath it all
Nothing seems to be
Nothing tastes as sweet as what I cant have
Like you and the way you're twisting your hair round your finger
Tonight I'm not afraid to tell you
What I feel about you

I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
And cannonball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
For you i will for you I will

Forgive me if I st-stutter
From all of the clutter in my head
Cause I could fall asleep in those eyes
Like a water bed
Do I seem familiar
I crossed you in hallways a thousand times
No more camoflauge
I want to be exposed
And not be afraid to fall

I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
And cannonball into the water

I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you cant have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
For you I will for you I will for you I will

If I could dim the lights in the mall to create a mood, I would
And shout out your name so it echoes in every room
I would

Thats what I'd do
Thats what I'd do
To get through to you

I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
And cannonball into the water
I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
For you I will
Always want what you cant have
But I've got to try
I'm gonna muster every ounce of Confidence I have
For you I will for you I will for you I will
