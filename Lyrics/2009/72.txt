To the bad, to the bad, to the bad, to the bad
To the bad, to the bad, to the bad (to the bad, to the bad)

Made of money, I was thinking about her all week
Would've treated her to some Grigio, and fresh brie
The way we vibing it reminded me of ice tea
Want to drink it up so baby come and let's leave

Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl
Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl

Got me grooving when I'm turning on the radio
If you feel it baby go ahead and let me know
We could run away and hang out on the country side
'Cause not a problem in the world if it's just you and I

Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl
Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl

Bad to the bad to the bad to the bone
Look real close, I should've known
Heels and the toes to be matching her coat
And the jewels and the rose just to add to the show
Hm mm fine, Clementine, what I gotta do to make you mine?
Girl you set my heart on fire
Open fire, I could die from
Sweet tea, and I need refreshment
The best in sheets, better keep me guessing
Must aim to please, teach me a lesson
Geek Van der Beek, dawg, greek a second
All stop, bombaclot
Do you want to run to the sun or not
If you wanna fly better come inside
Come along we'll go for a ride

To the bad to the
To the bad to the
To the bad to the (to the bad to the, to the bad to the)

To the bad to the
To the bad to the
To the bad to the (to the bad to the, to the bad to the)

Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl
Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl

Sweet, tangerine girl
Sweet, girl
